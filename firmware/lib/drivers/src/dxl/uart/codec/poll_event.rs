/// `WriteDataChunk` `(offset, length)` into a contiguous ring slice via
/// `ring` (empty for other events). `next_status_pos` is the codec's
/// wire-byte position at this event's emit point — the value
/// `wire_bytes_consumed` will hold after the parser has consumed the
/// bytes that produced this event. Named for its load-bearing use: the
/// Fast Last fold path captures it at the chain instruction's Crc event
/// as `fold_start_cursor` — at that point it equals the wire position
/// where the First predecessor's status packet will start (the next byte
/// on the wire). At Header / Payload events the value is still the
/// codec's running cursor, but no consumer reads it there today.
/// `packet_end` is `Some` exactly at `Crc` events — see [`PacketEnd`].
/// `SkipComplete` emits when the universal byte-skip's remaining-byte
/// counter hits zero — `id` round-trips the value the sink passed in
/// [`PollAction::Skip`], so the chain predecessor-match check
/// (doc §5.2) can compare against `predecessor_id`.
